# Art With Machine Learning
The Art With Machine Learning program is created by: Brendan Cook, Blain Bahls, Tim Roberts, Brian Lamont, & Zak Rule.

The program takes a picture from a camera feed (webcam for example) and renders the picture taken in various artistic styles from renowned artists all around the world. The program has the capability of learning new artistic styles through the use of Tensorflow and the Nvidia CUDA/cudNN libraries to accelerate the training process of new styles through the use of GPU Hardware Acceleration.

To start the program, ensure a camera device is connected, run the "main.py" file within the GUI Layout folder, and install the necessary Python libraries when the command prompt lists what libraries are missing in order for the program to run properly.
