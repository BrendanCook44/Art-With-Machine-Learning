# Art With Machine Learning
The Art With Machine Learning program is created by:  
-Brendan Cook  
-Blain Bahls  
-Tim Roberts  
-Brian Lamont  
-Zak Rule  

The program takes a picture from a camera feed (webcam for example) and renders the picture taken in various artistic styles from renowned artists all around the world. The program has the capability of learning new artistic styles through the use of Tensorflow and the Nvidia CUDA/cudNN libraries to accelerate the training process of new styles through the use of GPU Hardware Acceleration.  

Instructions:  

1.) Ensure that a webcam or similar camera device is connected and that the display is set to 1920x1080 for the GUI to display properly.  
2.) Second, run the following commands within your python environment to install the necessary libraries for the program:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-pip install pyqt5  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-pip install tensorflow  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-pip install moviepy

Example:  



Thanks to the University of Toledo for allowing us to create such an awesome project to be used as a display piece within the College of Engineering!
